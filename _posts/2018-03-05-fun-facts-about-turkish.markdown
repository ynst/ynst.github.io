Did you know that producing in Turkish language is like playing lego?

Since it is an agglutinative language, you can build new words by adding syllables, and each syllable will give a new meaning to the word. For Turkish is a language in which you can keep adding syllables to the end of the word, you can create very long words by adding new suffixes.

For example: The word “Afyonkarahisarlılaştıramadıklarımızdan” is one of the longest words in Turkish, meaning “One of those people whom we tried to make resemble the citizens of Afyonkarahisar but we failed.”

“Siz bizim Afyonkarahisarlılaştıramadıklarımızdan mısınız?” means “Aren’t you one of those people whom we tried to make resemble the citizens of Afyonkarahisar but we failed?”

The word “yogurt” is a Turkish word, and it appears in the texts, starting from the 8th century on. In the earliest texts, it is spelled “yogurt” or “yogrut.” It was an important part of the Uyghur Turks, and it was listed among the four dishes served to the gods.

According to current Turkish students, it is interesting to learn that:

“Something that I always admired was the Turkish “hand-kissing” custom. Children and adults alike kiss the hands of their elders as a sign of respect. This is just one example of the love and respect that is so common to Turkish lifestyle.”

“One of my favorite customs is a traditional ceremony upon the engagement of a couple. When a girl and boy get engaged, the groom’s family comes to the home of the bride to formally request the girl’s hand in marriage. This ceremony is called ‘Kız istemek.'”

“Definitely my favorite fun fact about Turkey is that Turkish people love kolonya! This is a lemon-scented fragrance that is used as a cure for any disease. If you have a mosquito bite, spray kolonya on it. If you are feeling weak or faint or sick, smell some kolonya and you are instantly better. After visiting Turkey, you are sure to bring a bottle of Kolonya back home with you.”

“There is a tense that is used to describe reported things (the –mIş tense)”

For example: “Ben İstanbul’da doğ-muş-um.” means “I have been reported/told that I was born in Istanbul.” It is reported past, because we don’t remember our own birth. We learn/hear about it from our family or other people.

“In 1934 all Turkish people had to choose a surname, before that they didn’t have one.”

“Turkish people say ‘afiyet olsun!’ (the equivalent of ‘bon appetite’) during as well as after the meal.”

“Buzdolabı (refrigerator) literally means ‘cupboard of ice.'”

“The word for “married” (evli) literally means ‘with a house.'”

“There are many more words for different family members than in English, so you can be much more specific (if you remember all of them).”

“Every single word has either a ‘k’ or a ‘y’ in it.” (exaggeration!)

“I love that Temmuz (July), the ancient Babylonian word for a certain god, has survived as a month name.”

“Most of the loanwords comes from Arabic/Persian! ما شاءالله”

“I like how Turkish people like to to Turkify English words, ex. hijyen:hygene / pijama:pajama.”

“You can say whole English sentences in one Turkish word.”

“An acceptable reply to ‘How are you doing?’ is ‘İç güveysinden hallice,’ or ‘better than being at my in-law’s.'”

“To make a verb of a word, add ‘+la’ or ‘+le’ to end.”

“In Turkish, when someone is really overjoyed about something, you can say ‘Etekleri zil çalıyor,’ meaning ‘the bells on his/her skirt are ringing.’ When you’re really hungry, you can say ‘Karnım zil çalıyor,” meaning ‘My stomach bells are ringing.'”

“There is Turkish dessert that has chicken in it!” (Tavuk Göğsü)

“In Turkey, eggplant is a hugely popular dish and is included in a lot of things.”

“If you are lucky enough to study abroad in Istanbul, get ready to drink tea. Literally. All. The. Time. Thirsty? Drink tea! Not thirsty? Drink Tea!”

“Without different case endings, the verb ‘bayılmak’ can mean both ‘to faint’ or ‘to adore.’ So in Turkish, if you want to say you adore something you can say you ‘faint’ towards it.”

“The word ‘arkadaş,’ which means ‘friend,’ means ‘one who shares your back.'”

“‘Müdür, müdür müdür?’ means ‘Is the principle the principle?’ You can say a word three times in a row to make a sentence.”

“Turkish people see enjoying life as a necessary and important part of daily living. They take their time, drink tea or coffee for hours; they love to gossip and cook and talk to family about all the little details of their lives. Nothing makes a Turk happier than a good dessert and a beautiful view.”

“There exists a word that specifically means “to get thirsty for tea.” (Çaysamak)
